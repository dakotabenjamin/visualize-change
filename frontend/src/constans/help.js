    The progression of your dates of edit can be followed on the right hand side of the play bar.
    `,
    "basic-tab-help": `To build a standard edit animation enter a title, date range, map style and press play!
      You can see basic parameters in action.`,
    "describe-help": `Describe your animation in more detail. You can use any taxonomy to identify your project
      here with the Name, Project, and Description fields.`,
    "dates-help": `You animation can display edits over a specific time period with a specific frame rate of 
    progression. For example, the edits over the last year by stepping through snapshots for each month. 
    Or just have an editing event? See the edits over a week by an hourly interval. 
    Like an animation flipbook, these filters allow you to control the breadth and rhythm of your work.
    Changes take time to load on your browser to watch the loading circle for progress.`,
    "styles-help": `Refine the style and feature of your map within this style section.
    First choose from standard Mapbox basemap themes https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/setstyle/ 
    and then choose the features you’d like to animate. 
    By default an animation displays the roads in light blue and buildings in light red, each with a white highlight. 
    Experiment with the feature display and color combinations that make sense to you. 
    Changes will take a moment to load in the browser. Watch the thinking circle for progress.`
